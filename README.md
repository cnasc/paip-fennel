# paip-fennel
Exercises from Peter Norvig's "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence
Programming" in Fennel, a Lisp-on-Lua

## Goals
To learn Fennel better by doing a project with it. PAIP is an
important part of the Lisp canon, so it seems like a natural choice. I
will take notes as I work, hopefully resulting in a helpful
getting-started guide for other people who are already comfortable
with Common Lisp.
